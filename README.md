# Pokédex Website Version 2

## eveloped by: Erik Halenkamp

## About This Project:

This Pokédex was created as a spiritual successor to a class project I completed one year ago, in the Spring of 2020. I knew nothing of web technologies then, so I
simply used Java in order to compile the nearly thousand files of HTML, each with algorithmically-generated code. In the year since I undertook that project, however, my
tech stack has expanded and I decided to revisit it using a much less primitive method.

I designed my own API based off the same Java database that allowed me to create the Pokédex the first go around using the Springboot framework. The repository for this 
project can be found [here](https://github.com/ewhalenkamp/pokemonapi). Django is used in my backend to handle the API calls, template rendering, and url routes.

This project isn't perfect, certainly, and the API took a lot of optimization in order to render the main Pokédex list page within a reasonable amount of time. It's not all
too pretty, either, considering I used the exact same stylings as the original project with little to no variation.
